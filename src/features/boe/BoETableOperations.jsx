 * BoETableOperations
 * ---------------------
 * Provides filter and search controls for the Board of Examiners (BoE) table view.
 * - Offers filtering by academic year and status of papers
 * - Includes a search bar for keywords (likely subject code/name/etc)
 * - Is intended to be placed above the main BoETable to interactively scope/filter the data
 * - All controls are composed inside TableOperations for layout consistency
 *
 * Parent or context is responsible for wiring filter/search state to data fetcher/query keys.
